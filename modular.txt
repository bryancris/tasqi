I'll help you create a comprehensive plan for recreating the app with a modular architecture. Let me first examine some key files to understand the current structure better.

Read
src/App.tsx
Let me look at some additional files to understand the core components and features of the app better.

Read
src/components/dashboard/TaskBoard.tsx
Let me check the auth system and Supabase integration as well to understand the backend structure:

Read
src/contexts/auth/provider/AuthProviderComponent.tsx
Let me look at a few more critical files to understand the app structure better, particularly focusing on the data fetching and task management since that seems central to the application:

Read
src/hooks/use-tasks.tsx
Let me look at one more file to understand the notification system since it appears to be an important part of the app:

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each module, component, and function should have a single responsibility. This makes the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain.

### 2. Interface Segregation
APIs should be designed with minimal interfaces that are specific to client needs. Components should only depend on the interfaces they actually use.

### 3. Dependency Inversion
Higher-level modules should not depend on lower-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

### 4. Composition Over Inheritance
Build complex components by composing simpler ones rather than through inheritance hierarchies.

### 5. Feature Encapsulation
Each feature module should encapsulate all its concerns - components, hooks, types, and utilities - making it easy to modify or replace without affecting other parts of the application.

## Core Technical Decisions

### 1. State Management
- Use **React Query** for server state (tasks, user data, etc.)
- Use React Context for UI state with careful consideration of re-render performance
- Use local storage for persistence where appropriate

### 2. API Layer
- Create service abstractions for all Supabase interactions
- Implement consistent error handling and retry mechanisms
- Use TypeScript for strong typing of API responses and requests

### 3. Component Design
- Create atomic components that can be composed into more complex UIs
- Implement consistent prop interfaces
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Avoid prop drilling with context where appropriate

### 4. Styling Approach
- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Create reusable component classes for consistent design
- Use CSS variables for theming

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for feature workflows
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

### 6. Performance Considerations
- Implement code splitting by route
- Use memoization strategically to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Virtualize long lists (tasks, calendar events)
- Optimize images and assets
- Monitor and optimize bundle size

## Migration Strategy
1. Develop the new architecture alongside the existing codebase
2. Implement core functionality in the new architecture
3. Gradually migrate features one by one
4. Use feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations
5. Test thoroughly throughout the migration
6. Phase out old code as new features reach parity

## Code Quality Standards
- Consistent naming conventions
- Documentation for all modules and complex functions
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Linting and formatting with ESLint and Prettier
- Code reviews for all changes
- Performance and accessibility audits

## Next Steps
1. Set up the new project structure
2. Create the core module and utilities
3. Implement the API layer with Supabase integration
4. Build the UI component library
5. Begin implementing the first feature module (Auth)
This plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to rebuilding the TASQI app with a modular architecture that will be more maintainable and scalable. The development order ensures that foundational elements are in place before building specific features, and the modular structure creates clear boundaries between different parts of the application.
